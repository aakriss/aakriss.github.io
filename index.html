        <h2>Rubik’s Cube Design Journey</h2>

        <h3>The World’s Smallest Rubik’s Cube Attempt</h3>
        <p>I began this project aiming to break the world record for the smallest functional Rubik’s cube, which stood at 5.6mm. With rapid advancements in 3D printing, a 5mm cube seemed achievable. I modeled it in SolidWorks, engineering a unique snapping mechanism small enough to hold the centers onto a spherical core—no screws or springs involved.</p>
        <p>After researching material properties and tolerances, I designed prongs under 0.2mm wide, capable of flexing during assembly but rigid enough to stay in place. Printing quotes ranged from $350 to $2500, so I tested a scaled-up PLA version on an FDM printer. The first prototype failed due to loose tolerances, so I rebuilt it from scratch with adjustable spacing. Through iteration, I found that zero clearance between parts performed best.</p>
        <p>Once the design was functional, I adapted it for a high-stiffness resin and contacted a university lab with a suitable micro-printer. But before the print could be made, Rubik’s released a 5mm cube commercially. Discouraged, I downsized my cube to 4.5mm but never printed it. The record was gone.</p>

        <h3>From Small to Fast: The Custom Speedcube</h3>
        <p>Still motivated, I pivoted to creating a high-performance speedcube. With full 3D printer access and no constraints, I redesigned the cube using magnets, springs, and screws. I studied commercial cubes, extracting the best features into a custom design. Early FDM prototypes, printed with a 0.2mm nozzle and 0.06mm layer height, felt great—textured surfaces even improved lube retention.</p>
        <p>The main issue became surface imperfections from support structures. I experimented with part orientation, support settings, and interface distances. After many iterations, I found a setup that minimized visible flaws and preserved internal mechanics. I printed and refined the model dozens of times until it felt right.</p>

        <h3>Key Innovations and Features</h3>
        <p>This project involved solving challenges across multiple design fronts—from precision geometry and flexural snap-fit mechanics to optimizing part tolerances for different materials. Careful attention was paid to print orientation, support strategy, and functional resilience in both scaled and full-size versions.</p>

        <p>One notable aspect was the development of a modern magnet system to compete with high-end speedcubes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Edge-Corner Magnets:</strong> Installed during printing (2 per edge, 3 per corner, 48 total) to enhance alignment and control.</li>
            <li><strong>Piece-Core Magnets:</strong> Inserted post-print into sockets to stabilize corners and edges (40 total).</li>
            <li><strong>Maglev System:</strong> Ring magnets replace springs, creating smooth, low-friction tensioning.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These systems were just one part of a larger mechanical design that required iteration, testing, and optimization. The end result was a high-performing, completely custom cube—built from the ground up to meet both speedcubing and micro-scale engineering goals.</p>
